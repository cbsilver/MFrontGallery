# About the `MFrontMaterials` project and its connection with the `MFrontGallery` project

The `MFrontMaterials` project is developped by CEA, EDF and Framatome a
part of the `PLEAIDES` platform
[@plancq_pleiades_2004;@marelle_new_2016]. It is dedicated to the
material knowledge management of fuel performance codes developed in
this platform. As it contains valuable and sensitive material data, the
`MFrontMaterials` has a restricted access.

However, this project shares the same [cmake
infrastructure](cmake-infrastructure.html) as the `MFrontGallery`
project.
