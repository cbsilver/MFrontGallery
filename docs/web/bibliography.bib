abstract = {The present work discusses a finite-strain plasticity model for soft clays. To motivate such a model, the infinitesimal-strain assumption is shown to be inadequate for the constitutive description of soft clays. Hence, assuming the multiplicative elasto-plastic decomposition of the deformation gradient, a finite-strain Cam-clay model is presented. In particular, with respect to the original Cam-clay formulation, this model improves the description of the isotropic compression behaviour as well as of the elastic shearing response. The constitutive laws are discussed and their implications are pointed out. The physical meaning of the model parameters is carefully addressed. Finally, the ability to properly match some experimental results available in the literature is assessed. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Borja1990,
abstract = {Two stress integration algorithms based on implicit calculation of plastic strain are implemented and tested for the modified Cam-Clay plasticity model. The integration rules fall under the category of return mapping algorithms in which the return directions are computed by closest point projection for associative flow rule and by central return mapping for non-associative flow rule applied to the Cam-Clay ellipsoids. Stress updates take place at the Gauss points upon enforcement of the consistency condition in which the appropriate consistency parameters are determined iteratively on the scalar level. Numerical examples with geotechnical applications, which include an analysis of foundation bearing capacity and an investigation of deformations in vertical cuts, are discussed to demonstrate the global accuracy and stability of the numerical solution. The relationships among various return mapping schemes are discussed in the context of both associative and non-associative flow rule formulations. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

@article{Borja1998,
abstract = {The infinitesimal version of the modified Cam-Clay model of critical state soil mechanics is reformulated to include finite deformation effects. Central to the formulation are the choice of a hardening law that is appropriate for cases involving large plastic volumetric strains, and the use of a class of two-invariant stored energy functions appropriate for Cam-Clay-type models that includes, as special cases, the constant elastic shear modulus approximation as well as the pressure-dependent shear modulus elastic model. The analytical model is cast within the framework of finite deformation theory based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. For the fully elasto-plastic case, return mapping is done implicitly in the space defined by the invariants of the elastic logarithmic principal stretches, which requires the solution at each stress point of no more than three simultaneous non-linear equations. A finite element analysis of a strip footing problem is presented to illustrate a prototype example where finite deformation effects significantly impact the predicted response. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

@article{Ashrafi2016,
abstract = {The present work develops three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive models for dense and porous shape memory alloys (SMAs). The models are extensions of a recent work and considers pressure dependent behavior for porous SMAs as well as the coupling effects of transformation and plasticity for both dense and porous SMAs. In contrast to dense SMAs, a considerable plastic strain accumulates in porous SMAs even during phase transformation. Therefore, an effective solution algorithm for simultaneous evolution of transformation and plastic strain is presented via replacement of the classical Kuhn-Tucker inequality conditions by the so-called Fischer-Burmeister complementarity function. Numerical predictions are compared with experimental results and a comprehensive study is performed on the material parameters regarding coupling effects and pressure dependency. Moreover, we implement the model using corotational formulation and perform finite element analysis of a porous SMA spring actuator, and a tube under non-proportional loading to assess the reliability of the proposed model for large rotations and general multiaxial loadings.},

@article{Bartel2019,
abstract = {This contribution deals with investigations on enhanced Fischer–Burmeister nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) functions applied to a rate-dependent laminate-based material model for ferroelectrics. The framework is based on the modelling and parametrisation of the material's microstructure via laminates together with the respective volume fractions. These volume fractions are treated as internal-state variables and are subject to several inequality constraints which can be treated in terms of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The Fischer–Burmeister NCP function provides a sophisticated scheme to incorporate Karush–Kuhn–Tucker-type conditions into calculations of internal-state variables. However, these functions are prone to numerical instabilities in their original form. Therefore, some enhanced formulations of the Fischer–Burmeister ansatz are discussed and compared to each other in this contribution.},

@article{Helfer2015,
abstract = {The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between {\'{E}}lectricit{\'{e}} de France (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES's main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems. This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++ (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/. The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered. In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code-Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow. We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.},

abstract = {Analytical solutions are derived for a three-invariant Cam clay model subjected to proportional and circular drained loading histories. The solutions are presented for a specific volume, and volumetric and generalized shear strains. In the case of a proportional loading only straight effective stress paths are considered while in the case of a circular loading the maximum possible change in Lode's angle is $\pi$/3 due to plastic isotropy. Additionally, a concept of deviatoric stiffness is devised and an analytical expression for the generalized hardening modulus is derived. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are carried out in the form of direct comparisons between analytical solutions for drained and undrained loading histories thus offering an improved understanding of the three-invariant model.

@article{Gaume2018,
abstract = {Continuum numerical modeling of dynamic crack propagation has been a great challenge over the past decade. This is particularly the case for anticracks in porous materials, as reported in sedimentary rocks, deep earthquakes, landslides, and snow avalanches, as material inter-penetration further complicates the problem. Here, on the basis of a new elastoplasticity model for porous cohesive materials and a large strain hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian numerical method, we accurately reproduced the onset and propagation dynamics of anticracks observed in snow fracture experiments. The key ingredient consists of a modified strain-softening plastic flow rule that captures the complexity of porous materials under mixed-mode loading accounting for the interplay between cohesion loss and volumetric collapse. Our unified model represents a significant step forward as it simulates solid-fluid phase transitions in geomaterials which is of paramount importance to mitigate and forecast gravitational hazards.},
