# MFrontGallery

This project aims at gathering high quality, thoroughly tested, well
written, efficient and **ready-to-use** `MFront` implementations of
various material properties, behaviours and models.

It is mainly decomposed in two parts:

- `generic-behaviours`: this part is dedicated to various mechanical
  behaviours that can be adapted to describe many materials. Those
  behaviours are sorted by category:
    - `hyperelasticity`
    - `hyperviscoelasticity`
    - `damage`
    - `plasticity`
    - `viscoelasticity`
    - `viscoplasticity`
- `materials`: this part gathers to specific materials.

The last purpose of this project is to show how to build a compilation
project for `MFront`'s properties, behaviours and models.

# Versions, branches, tags

- the `master` branch follows the evolution of the `master` branch of
  the `TFEL` project
- the `rliv-1.1` follows the evolution of the 3.3.x series of the `TFEL`
  project.
- the `rliv-1.0` follows the evolution of the 3.2.x series of the `TFEL`
project.
- tag `MFrontGallery-1.1` is meant to be build against
  `TFEL` 3.3.0
- tag `MFrontGallery-1.0.1` is meant to be build against `TFEL` 3.2.1
- tag `MFrontGallery-1.0` is meant to be build against
  `TFEL` 3.2.0
